#  Striver A2Z DSA Sheet Progress

This repository contains my consistent practice and solutions for the [Striver A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/).  
Iâ€™m solving each topic step-by-step in Python, building strong fundamentals in Data Structures & Algorithms.

---

## Completed Sections

-  Arrays (All foundational, intermediate, and hard problems)
-  Binary Search (On 1D arrays and advanced variations)
-  Basic Strings (Character arrays, manipulation, palindrome logic)

 **Progress**: ~85% completed for the sections above.

##  Currently Solving

-  **Linked Lists**
  - Insertion at head, tail, position, before value
  - Deletion
  - Reversal
  - Cycle detection, etc.

Stay tuned as I keep pushing more code!
